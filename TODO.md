# To do

Modify celestial.inc so it uses `$almanac.sun.visible`

Review the I18N documentation.

Modify installation software so the user can pick a unit system.

NICE TO DO:
Parameterize PIL fonts on the basis of `lang`.

Allow downloading and memoizing fonts, so we don't have to ship every font out there.
