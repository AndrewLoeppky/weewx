# To do

Review the I18N documentation. Needs some text on the hierarchy of setting `lang`
and `units`. 

Modify installation software so that the user can pick a unit system.

NICE TO DO:
Parameterize PIL fonts on the basis of `lang`.

Allow downloading and memoizing fonts, so we don't have to ship every font out there.
