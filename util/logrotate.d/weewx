# for a typical configuration, use copytruncate instead of create, since weewx
# does not know how to reopen a log file.  this has the risk of losing log
# messages that are made after the copy but before truncation, but it ensures
# that weewx will write to the correct log file after rotation.
  copytruncate

# on some systems rsyslog must be restarted to send output to right file
#  sharedscripts
#  postrotate
# standard way of invoking rc scripts
#    /etc/init.d/rsyslog stop
#    /etc/init.d/rsyslog start
# on some systems a reload will work
#    /etc/init.d/rsyslog reload > /dev/null
# some ubuntu systems use upstart
#    service rsyslog restart > /dev/null
# some redhat/fedora systems have their own way
#    reload rsyslog > /dev/null 2>&1
# some debian systems do it this way
#    invoke-rc.d rsyslog reload > /dev/null
#  endscript

# on some systems the permissions do not propagate, so force them
# debian uses root:adm
#  create 644 root adm
# ubuntu uses syslog:adm
#  create 644 syslog adm
